What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n","\n","The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n","\n","**a) Classes and Objects:**\n","\n","**Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n","\n","**Object:** An instance of a class. Objects are concrete instances that hold actual values for the properties defined by the class.\n","\n","**b) Encapsulation:**\n","Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data (usually achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public).\n","\n","**c) Inheritance:**\n","Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child or subclass) derives properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchical relationship between classes.\n","\n","**d) Polymorphism:**\n","Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even when they are actually instances of a child class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n","\n","There are two types of polymorphism:\n","\n","**I) Compile-time (method overloading):** Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.\n","\n","**II) Run-time (method overriding):** A child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n","\n","**g) Abstraction:**\n","Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts. In OOP, it allows developers to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it, often through abstract classes and interfaces."],"metadata":{"id":"pAdlYBskXXBz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.

Here's a breakdown:\n","\n","**Instance Methods**\n","\n","**Definition:** Instance methods are the most common type of method in Python classes. They are called on an instance of the class and can access and modify the object's attributes.\n","\n","**Usage:** They operate on the instance-specific data (object-specific data) and have access to the instance (self).\n","\n","**Example of an Instance Method:**\n","\n","\n","    class Dog:\n","        def __init__(self, name, breed):\n","            self.name = name\n","            self.breed = breed\n","    \n","        def bark(self):\n","            return f\"{self.name} is barking!\"\n","\n","    # Creating an instance of Dog\n","    my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n","\n","    # Calling the instance method\n","    print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy is barking!\n","\n","**Class Methods**\n","\n","**Definition:** Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They take cls as their first parameter instead of self, which refers to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.\n","\n","**Usage:** They can modify class-level attributes that apply to all instances of the class, and they are called on the class itself rather than an instance of the class.\n","\n","**Decorator:** Class methods are marked with the @classmethod decorator.\n","\n","**Example of a Class Method:**\n","\n","    class Dog:\n","        species = \"Canis lupus familiaris\"  # Class attribute\n","\n","        def __init__(self, name, breed):\n","            self.name = name\n","            self.breed = breed\n","    \n","        def bark(self):\n","            return f\"{self.name} is barking!\"\n","    \n","        @classmethod\n","        def get_species(cls):\n","            return f\"The species of this dog is {cls.species}\"\n","\n","    # Calling the class method\n","    print(Dog.get_species())  \n","    # Output: The species of this dog is Canis lupus familiaris\n","\n","**Key Differences:**\n","\n","**Binding:**\n","\n","Instance methods are bound to instances of the class, meaning they operate on specific instances.\n","Class methods are bound to the class itself and operate on the class-level data.\n","\n","**First Parameter:**\n","\n","Instance methods use self as the first parameter to refer to the instance calling the method.\n","Class methods use cls as the first parameter to refer to the class that calls the method.\n","\n","**Calling:**\n","\n","Instance methods are called on instances of the class.\n","Class methods are called on the class itself or an instance, but they affect class-level attributes.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"P5tE36Ivab-O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.**\n","\n","Python does not support traditional method overloading as seen in some other languages like Java or C++. In those languages, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. However, Python provides ways to achieve similar functionality using default arguments, variable-length argument lists, and keyword arguments.\n","\n","**Method Overloading in Python**\n","\n","In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition will override the previous ones. To mimic method overloading, you can use the following techniques:\n","\n","**Default Arguments:** You can define a method with default values for parameters, allowing the method to handle different numbers of arguments.\n","\n","**Variable-Length Arguments:** Use *args and **kwargs to accept a variable number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.\n","\n","**Example of Mimicking Method Overloading**\n","\n","Here's an example using default arguments and *args to mimic method overloading:\n","\n","    class MathOperations:\n","        def add(self, *args):\n","            return sum(args)\n","\n","    # Example usage\n","    math_op = MathOperations()\n","\n","    # Adding two numbers\n","    print(math_op.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n","\n","    # Adding three numbers\n","    print(math_op.add(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n","\n","    #    Adding four numbers\n","    print(math_op.add(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10\n","**Explanation:**\n","\n","***args:** The *args parameter allows the method to accept any number of positional arguments.

Describe the five types of inheritance in Python. Provide a simple example of multiple inheritance.**\n","\n","In Python, inheritance is a fundamental feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (the subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the superclass). Here are the five types of inheritance commonly used in Python:\n","\n","**a. Single Inheritance**\n","\n","**Definition:** In single inheritance, a class (subclass) inherits from one and only one parent class (superclass).\n","\n","**Usage:** It's the simplest form of inheritance and is used to create a new class based on an existing class.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","    class Animal:\n","        def speak(self):\n","            return \"Animal speaks\"\n","\n","    class Dog(Animal):\n","        def bark(self):\n","            return \"Dog barks\"\n","\n","    # Example usage\n","    dog = Dog()\n","    print(dog.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks\n","    print(dog.bark())   # Output: Dog barks\n","\n","**b. Multiple Inheritance**\n","\n","**Definition:** In multiple inheritance, a class inherits from more than one parent class. This allows the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple superclasses.\n","\n","**Usage:** It’s used when a class needs to combine functionality from more than one class.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","    class Father:\n","        def skills(self):\n","            return \"Gardening, Painting\"\n","\n","    class Mother:\n","        def skills(self):\n","            return \"Cooking, Dancing\"\n","\n","    class Child(Father, Mother):\n","        def hobby(self):\n","            return \"Playing video games\"\n","\n","    # Example usage\n","    child = Child()\n","    print(child.skills())  # Output: Gardening, Painting (from Father)\n","    print(child.hobby())   # Output: Playing video games\n","\n","**c. Multilevel Inheritance**\n","\n","**Definition:** In multilevel inheritance, a class (grandchild) inherits from a derived class (child), which in turn inherits from another base class (grandparent). This creates a chain of inheritance.\n","\n","**Usage:** It's used to establish a hierarchy where a class is built upon an existing class which itself is derived from another class.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","\n","    class Grandparent:\n","        def show(self):\n","            return \"Grandparent\"\n","\n","    class Parent(Grandparent):\n","        def show(self):\n","            return \"Parent\"\n","\n","    class Child(Parent):\n","        def show(self):\n","            return \"Child\"\n","\n","    # Example usage\n","    child = Child()\n","    print(child.show())  # Output: Child\n","\n","**d. Hierarchical Inheritance**\n","\n","**Definition:** In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class. All the subclasses share the same parent class.\n","\n","**Usage:** It’s used when multiple classes share common functionality provided by a single base class.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","\n","    class Vehicle:\n","        def drive(self):\n","            return \"Driving a vehicle\"\n","\n","    class Car(Vehicle):\n","        def honk(self):\n","            return \"Car horn\"\n","\n","    class Bike(Vehicle):\n","        def ring_bell(self):\n","            return \"Bike bell\"\n","\n","    # Example usage\n","    car = Car()\n","    bike = Bike()\n","    print(car.drive())      # Output: Driving a vehicle\n","    print(car.honk())       # Output: Car horn\n","    print(bike.drive())     # Output: Driving a vehicle\n","    print(bike.ring_bell()) # Output: Bike bell\n","\n","**e. Hybrid Inheritance**\n","\n","**Definition:** Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It often involves multiple and hierarchical inheritance, creating a more complex hierarchy.\n","\n","**Usage:** It's used when multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance need to be combined to form a complex class hierarchy.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","\n","    class Animal:\n","        def eat(self):\n","            return \"Eating\"\n","\n","    class Mammal(Animal):\n","        def walk(self):\n","            return \"Walking\"\n","\n","    class Bird(Animal):\n","        def fly(self):\n","            return \"Flying\"\n","\n","    class Bat(Mammal, Bird):\n","        def sleep(self):\n","            return \"Sleeping\"\n","\n","    # Example usage\n","    bat = Bat()\n","    print(bat.eat())    # Output: Eating\n","    print(bat.walk())   # Output: Walking\n","    print(bat.fly())    # Output: Flying\n","    print(bat.sleep())  # Output: Sleeping\n","\n","Each type of inheritance provides different ways to organize and reuse code, and the choice of which type to use depends on the specific requirements of the design and the relationships between the classes."],"metadata":{"id":"eqlOWIOwslSo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**7.

Explain the concept of the Diamond Problem in multiple inheritance.
